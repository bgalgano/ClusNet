Completed
- Run a bunch of models on CPU (still relatively fast)
- hyperparameters tested
    - kernel initalizers
    - loss functions (kinda, see troubleshooting)
    - epochs
    - Adam learning rate
    
Notes
- accuracy is not a good representation of metrics for segmentation models
- mean iou much better


Troubleshooting
- best loss function recommending for segmentation not working (still)
    - binary_crossentropy (bug, can't run)
    - dice loss (haven't tried yet)
    - mean iou (not a good performance)
- he normal kernel initializer not working as well as recommended

Questions
- is the output of the unet a probability statistic or approximate one-hot encoding?


Goals of the summer
- work on paper draft as new progress is made
    - start inserting key plots / tables
