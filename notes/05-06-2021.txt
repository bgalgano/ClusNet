50% of total clusters
20% of 50% is validation set
- cluster or not cluster?
    - 0 no cluster
    - 1 cluster
- noise added
- non-shifted
- 50 epochs
- performance: good
- relu activation, sigmoid for last layer

151e0
same as above, but with no noise

eu530
same as above
no noise
epoch = 20
notes: stalled completely

notes from meeting:

troubleshooting:
- stagnant loss problem
    - use bigger learning rate
    - learning rate initial
    - behaivor likely to go away once we add AGN noise
    
- you can save a model before it has trained
    - use saved successful model 
    

- add point sources as noise?
    - option 1: reach out to eRosita Ezra, Johan?
        - Johan runs sims
        - Ezra cluster cosmology team
    - option 2: go back to magnectium
        - option to turn on AGN or not
    - option 3:
        - look up eRosita point spread function (PSF)
            - produce artifical psf myself
            - two free parameters: 1. how many photons 2. width of gaussian
            - same number of photons as clusters for now
    - option 4:
        - michelle send email to some folk to ask about AGN modeling/noise adding
        - will do tomorrow
        
        
future plans    
- do segmentation mapping according to my own interest (secondary priority)
- keep in mind that if this project content is presented, should have a robust model with associated figures that convince board of results ("wow" figures)
    - figure ideas
        - residual plot (histogram)
        - training data sample figure
        - some figures that highlight difference in performance between high or low mass clusters
- 

- before end of semester:
    - try to write slides while material is still fresh
- for handling off project:
    - provide model arch.
    - data set (and associated code/documentation)
    - comment code
