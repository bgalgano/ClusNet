troubleshooting:
    memory issues:
        reach out to john about memory issues
        maybe may have to go to help desk,

        numpy array makes a new copy when you give it to a function

        consider using smaller batches
        consider not augmenting data quite as much

        image generator
        
    1.0s issue:
        take same training dataset, load model, and apply model to training set and compare
        then test on validation data
        
        if it fails on training set, then it is a bookkeeping issue
        
   UNET segmentation
       ask John for help with Unet and how he's preparing data
   
unpleasant task day
    - unsurprised
