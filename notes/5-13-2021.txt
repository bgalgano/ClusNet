- leaky vs non-leaky relus?
    - if neuron has value above 0, stays with current value
    - if neuron has value below 0, maps to 0
   
- should probably be saving training and validation images for each run 
    as a numpy array
- save one instance and just use that for now
- can save numpy array in scratch folder
- this is because we want to evaluate failures by looking at their noise (esp. when we add agns)

# numpy array shape: (number of clusters, height, width, 1) ?

troublesooting ROC curves:
    - maybe current successful model is memorizing noise which is why it always precits a cluster present 
    - maybe an indexing error
    - maybe make multiple versions of the same cluster but with different noise
    
    
- Segementation maps next time
    - take input cluster, apply gaussian kernel, and then make every pixel above 0 equal 1
