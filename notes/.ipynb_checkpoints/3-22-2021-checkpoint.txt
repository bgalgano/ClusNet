To-do:
- improved: saving of model assests and weights
- improved: organization of model information


Notes to self and detailed tasks completed
- re-evaluated status/understanding of cuda/anaconda3 modules and environments with MARCC
- trying to optimize GPU/tensorflow interaction with latest version of tensorflow and utilizing GPU (setting correct environments, e.g. above)
- fixing performance discrepancies between local machine and MARCC (MARCC performing better now)
    - kind of a solution?? using debug gpu to perform tasks. (interact command), uses gpu
    - 1s per epoch from 6-8s per epoch
- analyzed loss and accuracy across epoch: 1to1 figures improve but loss function is basically flat for most later epochs
- rethinking changing compliler settings to improve loss function
- use "mirror" images as part of training

RUNS:
    gpu: debug for all

explored:
    - +/- epoch number (slight improvement)
    - changing loss function from mse to mae to huber (no improvement) at epoch = 100
    - * winning run
    - changing compiler function from adam to sdg

center_x_y/wWXVU

center_x_y/NEuj2
epochs = 100
loss: mae
optimizer: sgd

problem: cannot seem to properly actually use gpu power on MARCC (s per epoch is just as slow on local machine)
