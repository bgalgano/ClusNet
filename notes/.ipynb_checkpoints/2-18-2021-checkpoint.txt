one-on-one - [2/18/2021]

done this week:
- created cluster object code
- imaging plotting and randomizing cluster locations
    - grabbed R pixel size and plot
    - updated shift constraints to prevent cluster wrapping around image borders
- discussion with Nadia and Rosie on state of research rotation
- considered ways of improvement for research progress (Below)

talking points:
    - apologize for lack of progress
    - miscommunication in satisfication in research progress:
        - specific tasks where met each week, but more ambiguous tasks
            - sign of me being unfamiliar in the field and not sure what to tackle first
        - thought it was mostly satisficatory since specific smaller tasks where met each week and discussion was had
    - honestly, though research progress was slow as well and wanted to go faster,
        - followed old pace because it didn't occur to ask for more work
    - fill out research advisor form
        
suggestions for improvement:
    - more specific task suggestions assigned
        - should work collaboratively to determine tasks

    - have performance review at mid and end of semester or season
    
    - meet more frequently but less time, more informal
    
        - utilize Tuesday office hours
            - currently would be best used for understanding CNNs
        - continue Thursday one-on-one times
        
    - clearer discussion on one-to-one meeting discussions
        - open the floor for ideas
        
    - me having confidence in the state of my advisor's perspective = less anxiety towards work = less procastination, openness to ask more questions, more frequent communication
    
    - follow Nadia and Rosie's suggestions 
        - commit to 'deep dive' with ML clusters
        - don't start new exoplanet rotation until summer
            - perhaps literature review with potential advisors and talks on the side
            
    - exploring ideas and tools for task managers
    
    - specifically schedule time blocks or hour quotas for work every week
            
To do:
    - write CNN from ground up??
    - continue 3brown1blue
    - ask for and review wavelet decomposition paper
