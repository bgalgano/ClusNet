CNN questions
1. what does feed-forward mean?
2. what is the difference between keras and tensorflow? keras is the frontend?
3. can you feed in layers to a keras model through a numpy array of layer objects and a loop?

let model run longer

# 
- look at predictions at training set vs test set
- if you have reasonable predictions for training set but bad values for test, then you probably overfitted
- if your test data is very different from your training data

next exercise:
gaussian noise
some photons in x, y gaussian
numpy.random.normal(shape=(128,128),)
