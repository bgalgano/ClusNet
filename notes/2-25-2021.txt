CNN questions
1. what does feed-forward mean?
2. what is the difference between keras and tensorflow? keras is the frontend?
3. can you feed in layers to a keras model through a numpy array of layer objects and a loop?

# 

how to make gaussian profile:
x = np.random.normal(mu=64,sigma=1,size=1000) # size= total or integrated number of photons
y = np.random.normal(mu=64,sigma=1,size=1000) 

# most photons in single pixel if sigma is 1 (pixel width)
bins = np.arange(0,129,1)

image = np.hist2d(x,y,bins=[bin,bin])
